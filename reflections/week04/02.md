## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending
Resolved
Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Way to write code to read top to bottom but looks cleaner

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then() is called after the promise is resolved, then we can decide what to do with the resolved Promise

.catch() is used for rejected promises and then jumps to the .catch()
